# projeto_ementa
Program to generate an menu for a nurse house, based on a list of meals, that can be incremented. The program will generate a monthly menu, considering certain rules about when and what types of food to serve.
In the end, was not necessary to finish this project, so the program, as it is, only generate a file with a calender, not generating the menu. I will probably not finish this, but i will save this in case i ever need to do something similar, specially the calendar part.
